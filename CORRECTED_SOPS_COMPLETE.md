## 🔑 Key Differences from Old SOPs

### ❌ OLD (Incorrect):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    "Test audience targeting rules",
    "Verify experience delivery",
    "Check personalization fallback"
  ]
}
```
**Problem**: These are training/testing instructions, not workflow procedures.

### ✅ NEW (Correct):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    "Create feature branch from main: git checkout -b feature/test-name",
    "Write automation scripts following framework standards",
    "Run tests locally and ensure 100% pass rate",
    "Commit with clear message: Add: Login page test suite",
    ...
  ]
}
```
**Correct**: These are actual process steps with specific commands and actions.
